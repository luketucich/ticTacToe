## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## The Takeaway

The biggest takeaway from my Tic Tac Toe project was learning how versatile JavaScript can be, especially when it comes to balancing console-based logic with DOM interactions. When I first built the game, I focused on making it fully functional in the console without any reliance on DOM manipulation. This taught me that you don't need to depend on the DOM to write solid logic—JavaScript can handle core functionality independently, which was a valuable realization.

Along the way, I also learned the importance of keeping my code encapsulated and modular. Using closures and Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs) really helped me control the flow of the game without exposing unnecessary variables to the global scope. Closures were key in managing player actions and game state, while IIFEs allowed me to structure my code in a way that executed immediately and safely.

This process showed me how clean and maintainable code can be when it’s properly organized, which made the transition to DOM-based interactions much smoother. All in all, this project really helped me level up my understanding of encapsulation, modular design, and core JavaScript principles.
